    <h1>About scripts that I am studying on web design</h1>
<p>Hi I am Konstantinos and I am 10 years old.</p>
<p>I like studying scripts about html or css and with other things like these.</p>
<table style="border:1px solid blue;"> 
    <tr>
        <td style="border:1px solid blue;">html code</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid blue;">studying every Saturday</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border:1px solid blue">css code</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid blue">started studying only 2 Saturdays</td>
    </tr>
</table>
  <p>I created this table to understand how often I am studying html code and how often css code</p>
  <p>Have you ever worked on html or css code?</p>
  <p>I think that if yo see that might think tha this will be boring</p>
  <p>But if you try it you'll see that it is very interesting.</p>
